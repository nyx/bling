# Bling

A basic Blockchain implementation written in TypeScript

### Motivation
-----

This project is motivated by the desire to better understand the fundamental concepts behind blockchain structures as well as a desire to play with TypeScript and Javascript build tools

### Usage
-----

Install dependencies using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
npm install
```

This project uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for building and packaging

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server you can experiment with automatic reloading in your browser which is wonderful

### Future
----

In no particular order:

 * experiment with a functional programming style
 * implement a browser hosted interface

### Credits
----
This TypeScript implementation was inspired and heavily influenced by this video

* [Creating a blockchain with Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124\) )
